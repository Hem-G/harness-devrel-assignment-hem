# üß† What this file does
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# 
# This file tells Kubernetes (through Kustomize) how to *assemble*
# the basic building blocks of your app before it‚Äôs deployed.
# 
# This file acts as the base blueprint for your application.
# It tells Kubernetes to combine your deployment.yaml (how to run the app)
# and service.yaml (how to expose the app) into one deployable package.
# 
# Later, environment-specific folders (like dev, qa, and prod)
# add small ‚Äúpatch‚Äù files on top of this base to adjust settings ‚Äî
# for example, increasing replicas in production or adding version labels.
#
# Think of it like a ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù that combines all the core ingredients ‚Äî
# your Deployment and Service files ‚Äî into one complete definition.
#
# Other environments (like Dev, QA, or Prod) can then ‚Äúreuse‚Äù this recipe
# and apply small differences on top ‚Äî like scaling up replicas,
# changing image versions, or adding labels.

# üß© The resources section
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# This section lists all the Kubernetes resource files (YAMLs)
# that make up your base application.
#
# When you run "kubectl apply -k k8s/base", Kustomize will:
#   - Load both of these files
#   - Combine them into one big configuration
#   - Apply any overrides or patches from environment overlays
# -----------------------------------------------------------
resources:
  - deployment.yaml   # Defines how the app runs (the pods)
  - service.yaml      # Defines how the app is accessed (the service)
