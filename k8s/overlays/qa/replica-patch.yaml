# 🧠 What this file does
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# This is a small “patch” file that tells Kubernetes (via Kustomize):
# “When you’re building the QA version of this app,
#  change the number of running pods (replicas) to 2.”
#
# It doesn’t replace the entire Deployment — just updates one setting.
# 
# This file customizes the QA environment by setting the number of running copies (replicas) of the app to 2.
# 
# QA usually simulates real-world usage more closely than Dev,
# so having 2 replicas allows testers to check load balancing, stability, and failover behavior.
# 
# Instead of duplicating the full Kubernetes Deployment file,
# this patch just says: “keep everything the same as Dev, but scale it to 2 pods.”

apiVersion: apps/v1       # Same API version as the base Deployment
kind: Deployment           # We’re modifying a Deployment resource
metadata:
  name: myservice          # Must match the name from the base file so Kustomize knows what to modify
spec:
  replicas: 2              # 🧩 In QA, we want 2 replicas for better load testing and reliability
                           # This ensures QA behaves more like production without wasting resources
