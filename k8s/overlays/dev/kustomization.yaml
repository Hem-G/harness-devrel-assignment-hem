# 🧠 What this file does
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# 
# This file customizes the “base” Kubernetes setup for the Dev environment.
# It keeps all the common setup (like container image, ports, and health checks)
# but adds a dev- prefix to resource names and applies small tweaks (patches).
# 
# This lets you reuse the same blueprint for QA and Prod,
# simply by creating different overlay folders with their own prefixes and patches.
#
# This file tells Kustomize:
# “Take the *base blueprint* for my app (from ../../base)
#  and make a Dev version of it.”
#
# The Dev version gets its own name prefix (“dev-”)
# and small configuration tweaks from another file called replica-patch.yaml.
#
# So this is like taking a master recipe (base)
# and adding a few ingredients to make a “Dev edition” of the dish.
# -----------------------------------------------------------

apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1  # Version of Kustomize format
kind: Kustomization                          # Declares this is a Kustomize overlay configuration

# -----------------------------------------------------------
# 🧩 Step 1: Reuse the Base Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# The base directory has the shared resources (deployment, service).
# This overlay reuses them by pointing to the folder two levels up.
resources:
  - ../../base

# -----------------------------------------------------------
# 🧩 Step 2: Add a Name Prefix
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# This adds “dev-” to the names of all generated Kubernetes resources.
# For example:
#   Deployment: myservice → dev-myservice
#   Service: myservice → dev-myservice
#
# This helps distinguish Dev, QA, and Prod resources inside the same cluster.
namePrefix: dev-

# -----------------------------------------------------------
# 🧩 Step 3: Apply a Patch File
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# The patch file (replica-patch.yaml) makes small environment-specific edits.
# For Dev, that usually means fewer replicas (maybe just one),
# or other low-resource tweaks suitable for testing environments.
patches:
  - path: replica-patch.yaml
